# pong
Atari's 1972 classic, implemented in Lua with LÃ–VE

This repo is forked from games50/pong. 

Aside from the incremental build of the game throughout the course, I've also added pong-ai which is a simple implementation of AI using the pong-final version. The player1 paddle will move based on the y position of ball. PADDLE_SPEED remains a constant, so the only way to beat the AI is probably to play until the speed of the ball is too fast for player1 paddle.
